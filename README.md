# Software-Testing-and-Automation-Specialization
Develop Skills in Software Testing. Practice and master theory, techniques, and tools to effectively test software.

## WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
* Distinguish between verification and validation describing the key differences between them.
* Write automated functional tests for both front-end and back-end code
* Measure the fault-finding effectiveness of a functional test suite using mutation testing.
* Defend program correctness through the use of formal methods, specifically proof obligations and model checking.

SKILLS GAINED
- Black-box Testing Techniques
- White-box Testing Techniques
- Unit Testing
- Static Analysis
- Testing Automation
- Writing Test Plans
- Writing Defect Reports
- Understanding of Testing Theory
- Writing Tests
- Testing Vocabulary
- Executing Tests
- Software Testing


## About this Specialization
This Specialization is intented for beginning to intermediate software developers seeking to develop knowledge and skill in implementing testing techniques and tools in the development of their projects. Through four courses, you will cover black-box and white-box testing, automated testing, web & mobile testing, and formal testing theory and techniques, which will prepare to you to plan and perform effective testing of your software.

## Applied Learning Project
Learners will build test plans, test suites, and test analysis reports. Learners will develop properties and assertions in code to facilitate automated test generation. Learners will also create pre-conditions for methods to facilitate formal proofs of correctness.
